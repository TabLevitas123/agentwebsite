- WebSocket-based real-time updates
- Redis-backed caching layer
- Microservices architecture
- Event-driven design pattern

### Active Development
- Time Series Data Service
- Alert Management System
- Testing Framework Implementation
- Documentation Updates

### Known Issues
1. Memory capacity approaching limit (81%)
2. Some test coverage gaps in newer components
3. Documentation needs updating for recent changes

## Critical Notes

### Memory Management
With 81% of project knowledge capacity used, careful consideration must be given to:
- Prioritizing remaining essential components
- Optimizing documentation storage
- Archiving completed component details
- Focusing on critical path items

### Next Steps Priority
1. Complete Time Series Data Service
2. Implement Alert Management System
3. Finish End-to-End Testing
4. Complete Documentation
5. Perform Security Audit

### Enterprise Standards
Maintain focus on:
- Code modularity (max 250 lines per file)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance optimization
- Security best practices
- Accessibility compliance
- Documentation completeness

## Verification Checklist
